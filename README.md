## About Debitspace
Debitspace is an open-source accounting software made for education.

With Debitspace, students can easily create tables and entries to accomplish various exercises and tasks in the accounting subject. Each tables contains an entries list which makes it easy to add, edit and delete entries.

Every table is only stored in the current web session and can easily be exported as a JSON-file to save your work even when you're switching to another computer or come back later.
Exported tables can be imported back to Debitspace using the JSON-Importer as well as processed in third-party apps to enable even more features.

You don't have to create an account or log-in in order to use Debitspace and all of its features. Since Debitspace is an open-source project, everyone is gladly invited to develop new features for this accounting software made for education!
